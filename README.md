I recently created this Netflix UI clone application project. It fetches the movie data from a third-party API. It also has trailer pop-ups functionality implemented into it. The clone has been built using React JS, Redux, React-hooks, Styled-component, Material-UI, TMDB API, and Firebase (hosting & Deploying). I also plan to add further functionality such as user authorization, a dedicated backend to maintain the user database, and replicate it as close as possible to the original website.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Steps Include : 
- Getting TMDB API Key
- Creating REACT App + Creating App on Firebase
- Getting all movies & building the Netflix movie rows
- Building the banner of the app
- Building the NAVBAR!
- Adding firebase hosting to your app
- Adding Netflix Movie Trailer POP-UPS!
- Deploying Your App to Firebase & Host it online
